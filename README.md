## Abstract

In this study we present a machine learning-based methodology to the assessment of pre-owned car prices in the Indian automotive market. We used a Kaggle provided used_cars dataset of over 5,000 vehicle listings to which we applied domain relevant features and we also went over a number of regression methods which included Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost, CatBoost and also a stacked ensemble model.Comprehensive data preparation was done which included the removal of outlying values using Interquartile Range, we transformed categorical attributes and also created new features like price per kilometer and horse power to age ratio. Also we did model optimization via Grid Search with cross-validation to guarantee stability and performance.Among the evaluated models the best performance was seen in the stacked ensemble (which included Ridge Regression, XGBoost, and LightGBM) that put out an R² of 0.9886, RMSE of ₹1.79 Lakhs, and MAE of ₹0.90 Lakhs. Also we saw that CatBoost did very well by itself with an R² of 0.9848.For a real-world deployment we put in place a Flask based web service for price prediction. This solution which goes beyond the auto industry by helping dealers set competitive prices, we also provide price transparency for the buyers, we aid financial institutions in their risk assessment and we also enable e- marketplaces to put in place intelligent valuation tools.Overall we see that machine learning greatly improves the accuracy, reliability and access of used car valuations in today’s ever changing auto market.
